"""Standards pack compiler — schema v0.4.

One source, two delivery builds plus a reference.

    SOURCE.md          the system, authored once, full detail
      -> SKILL.md          frontier build: core only, flat, minimum constraints
      -> SKILL-compact.md  small-model build: clustered, precedence, checklist
      -> REFERENCE.md      on-demand detail: rationales, registers, failure modes

Why two builds. Published work on instruction stacking finds that a rewrite which
clusters constraints, merges them and inserts precedence notes recovers roughly +11
points of follow rate on the weakest model tested, +3.3 on the middle one, and
essentially nothing on the strongest (-1.2, not statistically robust). Structure that
helps a small model is dead weight on a frontier one. So we ship both.

Why a core/reference split. Follow rate falls from ~96% at one instruction to 20-60%
at twenty. Every pack in this catalogue stacked 30-37 constraints. Only fewer active
constraints fixes that.

Why floors appear twice. Instructions in the middle of a long prompt lose compliance
relative to those at the edges. Anything non-negotiable goes at both ends.

A Standards pack, from Applied Form. This file is the entry point. Read it first.

## Always on — load these for every artefact

These are foundations. Retrieval will not surface them, because a request for one component
returns that component and nothing else, and the gaps get filled with assumptions.

### Floors — never varied, and they override everything below
{fb or "See SKILL.md."}

### Palette — no colour outside this set
{pal}

## On demand — retrieve when the task calls for it

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| The system's rules, on a frontier model | `SKILL.md` |
| The system's rules, on a small or fast model | `SKILL-compact.md` |
| Full rationales, conflict register, failure modes | `REFERENCE.md` |
| Token contract, machine-readable | `tokens.json` |
| Move index with triggers, machine-readable | `archetypes.json` |

Load `SKILL.md` **or** `SKILL-compact.md`, never both. The core carries
{core_constraints} constraints against a budget of {BUDGET}. Instruction-following degrades as
constraints accumulate, so loading the reference alongside the core costs compliance on
the core.

## Selecting a move

Archetypes are indexed by rhetorical job ({jobs_line}), not by visual form. Pick the one
whose trigger matches the situation. One move is active per artefact; the rest are
reference. Do not attempt to satisfy the whole index.

## Trust levels

| Action | Autonomy |
|---|---|
| Apply tokens, spacing, type scale | Auto |
| Select an archetype by its trigger | Auto |
| Resolve a rule collision using the conflict register | Auto |
| Resolve a collision the register does not cover | Ask |
| Introduce a colour, face or format outside the canon | Never |
| Vary an accessibility floor | Never |

## Before finalising

Restate and check the floors above. They are repeated deliberately: instructions in the
middle of a long context are followed less reliably than those at either end.
